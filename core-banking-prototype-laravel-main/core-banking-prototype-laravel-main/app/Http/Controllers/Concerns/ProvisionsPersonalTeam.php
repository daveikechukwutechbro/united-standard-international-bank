 * Provisions a Jetstream personal team for users created outside the

 * email-OTP signup paths (web {@see \App\Http\Controllers\Web\PrivyWebAuthController}
 * and mobile {@see \App\Http\Controllers\Api\Auth\LoginController::privyLogin}).
 *
 * Team features are enabled (config/jetstream.php), so every team-aware
 * Blade view dereferences `Auth::user()->currentTeam` (e.g.
 * navigation-menu.blade.php → `currentTeam->name`). `HasTeams::currentTeam()`
 * only auto-switches to the personal team when one already EXISTS; a
 * teamless user yields a null `currentTeam` and the first team-aware page
 * 500s. Password signups get their team from `CreateNewUser::createTeam()`
 * — the Privy paths must mirror that or new users hit a 500 the moment
 * they land on the dashboard.
 *
 * {@see ensurePersonalTeam()} runs on every Privy login (not just signup):
 * it also heals users left teamless by an earlier code path — mobile users
 * created before team provisioning existed, and web users whose pre-fix
 * signup 500'd *after* the User row was already inserted (a retry lands on
 * the returning-user branch and would otherwise 500 forever).
