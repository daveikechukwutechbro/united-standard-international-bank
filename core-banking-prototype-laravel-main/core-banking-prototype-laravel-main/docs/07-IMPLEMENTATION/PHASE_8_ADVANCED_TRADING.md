## Feature Implementation

### 1. Exchange Engine (Phase 8.1)

#### Order Book Management
- **Event-sourced architecture** using `OrderAggregate`
- **Saga-based matching engine** for reliable order execution
- **Support for market and limit orders**
- **Partial fill support** with proper accounting
- **Fee calculation** with maker/taker model

#### Code Example:
```php
// Place a limit order
$orderService = app(ExchangeServiceInterface::class);
$order = $orderService->placeOrder(
    accountId: $user->account_id,
    type: 'buy',
    orderType: 'limit',
    baseCurrency: 'BTC',
    quoteCurrency: 'USD',
    amount: '0.5',
    price: '45000'
);

// Cancel order
$orderService->cancelOrder($order->id);
```

#### Liquidity Pools
- **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** with constant product formula
- **Liquidity provider tokens** for tracking shares
- **Dynamic fee distribution** to LPs
- **Impermanent loss tracking**
- **Multi-asset pool support**

#### External Exchange Integration
- **Binance Connector**: Real-time order book and trading
- **Kraken Connector**: European market access
- **Coinbase Connector**: US market integration
- **Unified interface** for all exchanges
- **Arbitrage opportunity detection**

### 2. Stablecoin Framework (Phase 8.2)

#### Collateralized Stablecoin Issuance
- **Multi-collateral support** (ETH, BTC, other assets)
- **Health factor monitoring** with real-time valuation
- **Automated liquidation** at configurable thresholds
- **Oracle price aggregation** for accurate valuations
- **Emergency pause mechanism** for risk management

#### Code Example:
```php
// Mint stablecoins
$stablecoinService = app(StablecoinIssuanceServiceInterface::class);
$position = $stablecoinService->mint(
    userId: $user->id,
    stablecoin: 'EUSD',
    amount: '10000',
    collateral: [
        ['asset' => 'ETH', 'amount' => '5'],
        ['asset' => 'BTC', 'amount' => '0.2']
    ]
);

// Monitor health factor
$collateralService = app(CollateralServiceInterface::class);
$healthFactor = $collateralService->calculateHealthFactor($position);
```

#### Stability Mechanisms
- **Dynamic Stability Rate (DSR)** for supply control
- **Automated rebalancing** of collateral pools
- **Liquidation auctions** for underwater positions
- **Reserve fund management**

### 3. Blockchain Wallet System (Phase 8.3)

#### Multi-Chain Support
- **Bitcoin**: Native SegWit support

- **Polygon**: Layer 2 scaling
- **Binance Smart Chain**: Low-cost transactions

#### Key Management
- **HD Wallet Generation**: BIP44-compliant
- **Secure key storage** with encryption
- **Mnemonic phrase backup**
- **Hardware wallet support** (future)

#### Code Example:
```php
// Generate new wallet
$keyService = app(KeyManagementServiceInterface::class);
$mnemonic = $keyService->generateMnemonic();
$wallet = $keyService->generateHDWallet($mnemonic);

// Derive address for specific chain
$keyPair = $keyService->deriveKeyPair(
    encryptedSeed: $wallet['encrypted_seed'],
    chain: 'ethereum',
    index: 0
);

// Send transaction
$walletService = app(BlockchainWalletService::class);
$txHash = $walletService->sendTransaction(
    chain: 'ethereum',
    from: $keyPair['address'],
    to: '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f2bd6e',
    amount: '1.5',
    privateKey: $keyPair['private_key']
);
```

### 4. P2P Lending Platform (Phase 8.4)

#### Loan Lifecycle Management
- **Application workflow** with document upload
- **Credit scoring** using multiple data sources
- **Risk assessment** and categorization
- **Interest rate calculation** based on risk
- **Automated repayment processing**

#### Code Example:
```php
// Apply for loan
$loan = Loan::create([
    'borrower_id' => $user->id,
    'amount' => 10000,
    'currency' => 'USD',
    'term_months' => 12,
    'purpose' => 'business_expansion'
]);

// Credit scoring
$creditService = app(CreditScoringService::class);
$score = $creditService->calculateScore($user->id);

// Risk assessment
$riskService = app(RiskAssessmentService::class);
$assessment = $riskService->assessLoan($loan);
$loan->update([
    'risk_category' => $assessment->category,
    'interest_rate' => $assessment->suggestedRate
]);
```

#### Features Implemented:
- **Collateralized loans** with crypto collateral
